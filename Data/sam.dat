Throughout history, people have wondered who was the best empire. Majority of people know about the success of the Roman Empire for generations during their time period. The dominance they exhorted in their span still resonates with many of us today. The Roman Empire was the most successful of the classical empires. They were the most successful due to their government style of establishing a republic, and the superior location they had. Lastly, they were successful because of the strength and brutality of the army they created. These are the reasons why the Roman Empire was the most successful classical empire. Let’s starts by looking at how the Roman Empire was able to use the government system as an advantage for them.
	The Roman Empire succeeded because of the government style they used. They established a republic after overthrowing the monarchy. A republican government style is more effective than having a monarchy because the people are making the decisions instead of just one person. Also, it is more effective because power is widespread and does not remain in one family lineage. According to Chester Morton, he says, “In a republic, ultimate power resides with the people. However, the people, from time to time, relinquish that power to a group of people they call leaders, to exercise on their behalf for a specific number of years.”(Morton) In a republic, the power will lay with the people. While in a monarchy, the king will make all the decisions. Switching to a republic was beneficial for the Roman Empire, as they could make decisions as an empire. The Roman republic was also effective because of how it helped the lower class. As Strayer says in his book, “A system of public assemblies provided an opportunity for the lower class to shape public policy.”(Strayer 118) The Roman Empire sought involvement from all classes. This made the Roman Empire more successful as they knew everyone played a role for them. Overall, the Roman Empire switching to a republic played a major role in them being the most successful empire.
	The Roman Empire was also successful because of their location. The location they had allowed them to build allies and trade with them. Throughout history, trading has played a big role as empires need to trade for what they do not have. They were able to use their location they had as a stepping stool in gaining strength. This is explained by Strayer as he says, “Rome’s central location in the Mediterranean basin provided a convenient launching pad for the empire.”(Strayer 119) Location is not the reason why the Roman Empire is the most successful, but it is a reason to why they were able to become stronger. Although its proximity of neighbors was a strength, they used the physical features of their location to protect the empire. Rome was a peninsula which meant it was surrounded by water on three sides. The last side was protected by mountains.  Serving as an increase for defense, the sea and mountain border gave the Roman Empire a strength for defending against attacks. It would have been a bad plan to attack Rome because of how other empires needed to attack by boats or bring an army through mountains. Rome’s location also served as a strength through being central in the Mediterranean.  Since they were central, it provided Rome for ease of trading across water. Rome also was in a certain region that allowed agriculture to be possible for them. In conclusion, the Roman Empire was blessed with a great location, which helped with trading, defense, and agriculture. The location of Rome was a major strength in causing the Roman Empire to be the most successful of the classical empires.
	The last reason for the Roman Empire being the most successful classical empire was their army. They had arguably the best army of their day. The strengths of the Roman Empire can be explained by Strayer, “It was the army, ‘well-trained, well-fed, and well-rewarded,’ that built the empire.”(Strayer 119)  The army had many strengths as shown in this quote. The Roman Empire focused on making sure their army was the best because they understood the importance of having a powerful army. With this powerful army, they were able to take over other empires and utterly destroy them. For example, Carthage was a city completely demolished by the Roman Army.(Strayer 119) Having the ability to destroy cities was crucial, as it gave the Roman Empire the ability to take more land and extend their borders. A strong army was more important in this time period because there was a lack of allies within the world. Lack of allies caused more warfare between empires.  The success of the Roman Empire can be seen as James Lloyd says, “The Roman army, arguably one of the longest surviving and most effective fighting forces in military history.”(Lloyd) This shows the success of the Roman Empire as their army had arguably the most effective military force in history. A direct correlation between the success of the Roman Empire and their army. In summary, the Roman Empire had a strong army, which was one of the main reasons for them being the most successful empire.
	In conclusion, these different factors of the Roman Empire demonstrate how they were the most successful classical empire. This is due to the government style, the location of their empire, and the strength of their army. The Roman Empire was and will continue to be the most successful classical empire in history.
